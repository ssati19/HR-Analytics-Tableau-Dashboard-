The HR Analytics Dashboard project using Tableau is designed to provide insights into key metrics and trends related to human resource management in an organization. The dashboard utilizes visualizations and data analysis techniques to help HR professionals identify patterns and make data-driven decisions.
The dashboard includes several key visualizations that provide a comprehensive overview of HR-related metrics, including employee turnover rate, headcount, and employee engagement levels. The dashboard also includes metrics related to recruitment, including time-to-fill and cost-per-hire.

In addition to these metrics, the dashboard provides insights into employee performance, including metrics related to training and development, performance appraisals, and career progression. These metrics can help HR professionals identify areas for improvement and develop strategies for enhancing employee engagement and productivity.

The dashboard also includes interactive features that allow users to filter and drill down into specific data sets, such as department, location, or job level. This provides HR professionals with a more detailed view of their data, allowing them to identify patterns and trends more easily.

Overall, the HR Analytics Dashboard project using Tableau is an essential tool for any HR professional looking to gain deeper insights into their organization's HR data. By leveraging the power of Tableau's data visualization and analysis tools, HR professionals can make data-driven decisions that can help drive organizational success.
